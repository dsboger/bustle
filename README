Using Bustle
============

Capture some D-Bus traffic:

    bustle-pcap logfile.bustle

Now look at some diagrams and statistics based on it:

    bustle logfile.bustle

Or get some ASCII art versions of those stats:

    bustle --count logfile.bustle
    bustle --time logfile.bustle


FAQ

How do I log the system bus?
----------------------------

You need to edit /etc/dbus/system.conf to enable eavesdropping, and then
remove the include of /etc/dbus-1/system.conf.d which seems to re-enable
strictness. Please remember to undo your changes when you're done logging!
