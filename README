Compile the monitor:

    % make

Compile the charting application and utilities:

    On a debian based distribution you need to install the following
    packages: libghc6-gtk-dev libghc6-parsec-dev
    They pull in a lot of dependencies, but this is wanted :)

    % ./Setup.lhs configure --user
    % ./Setup.lhs build
    % ./Setup.lhs install

Capture some D-Bus traffic:

    % ./bustle-dbus-monitor > log
    ^C

Now chart it:

    % ~/bin/bustle log

Count the method calls and signal emissions:

    % ~/bin/bustle-count log

Make a .dot graph of method caller -> callee:

    % ~/bin/bustle-dot log >log.dot
    % dot -Tpng -o log-callers.png <log.dot

Count the total time spent in each method:

    % ~/bin/bustle-time log

FAQ

 - How do I log the system bus?
   * You need to edit /etc/dbus/system.conf to enable eavesdropping, and then
     remove the include of /etc/dbus-1/system.conf.d which seems to re-enable
     strictness. Please remember to undo your changes when you're done logging!
