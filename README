Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity, showing signal
emissions, method calls and their corresponding returns, with timestamps
for each individual event and the duration of each method call. This can
help you check for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your
D-Bus-based application isn't performing as well as you like. It also
provides statistics like signal frequencies and average method call
times.


Using Bustle
============

Capture some D-Bus traffic:

    bustle-pcap logfile.bustle

Now look at some diagrams and statistics based on it:

    bustle logfile.bustle

Or get some ASCII art versions of those stats:

    bustle --count logfile.bustle
    bustle --time logfile.bustle


FAQ
===

How do I log the system bus?
----------------------------

You need to edit /etc/dbus/system.conf to enable eavesdropping, and then
remove the include of /etc/dbus-1/system.conf.d which seems to re-enable
strictness. Please remember to undo your changes when you're done logging!
