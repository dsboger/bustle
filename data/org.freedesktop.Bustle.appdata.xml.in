		<_p>Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity.
		    It shows signal emissions, method calls and their
		    corresponding returns, with time stamps for each individual
		    event and the duration of each method call. This can help
		    you check for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your
		    D-Bus-based application isn't performing as well as you
		    like. It also provides statistics like signal frequencies
		    and average method call times.</_p>
