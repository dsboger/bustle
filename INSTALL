Building from source
====================

First, make sure the Haskell Platform is installed, preferably along with the
Gtk+ and Glade bindings for Haskell. On Debian-flavoured systems:

    sudo apt-get install haskell-platform libghc-gtk-dev libghc-glade-dev

If you can't get the Haskell Platform via your package manager, see
<http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/>. If you can't get the Gtk+ binding for
Haskell via your package manager, you'll need to run:

    cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools

and ensure that ~/.cabal/bin is in your PATH before continuing.

Got that? Great!

    export PREFIX=/opt/bustle

    # Build and install Bustle itself.
    cabal install --prefix=$PREFIX

    # Build and install the stand-alone logger binary.
    make install PREFIX=$PREFIX

If the Haskell Platform is not available on the platform you want to do
some D-Bus profiling on, that's fine: the logger is written in C, and
you can view logs generated on your fancy embedded hardware on your more
pedestrian Linux laptop. The logger depends on a few widely-available
libraries:

    sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libpcap-dev
