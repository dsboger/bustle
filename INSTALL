Building from source
====================

    export PREFIX=/opt/hi-mum
    cabal install --prefix=$PREFIX
    make install PREFIX=$PREFIX

Building Bustle itself requires the Haskell Platform (plus additional
dependencies which will be fetched by the `cabal install` command). On
Debian-flavoured systems:

    sudo apt-get install haskell-platform

Elsewhere, see <http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/> or your distro's
package manager.

If the Haskell Platform is not available on the platform you want to do
some D-Bus profiling on, that's fine: the logger is written in C, and
you can view logs generated on your fancy embedded hardware on your more
pedestrian Linux laptop.

The C bits compiled with `make` depend on a few things:

    sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libpcap-dev
