============================

Grab the latest code from git:

    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/bustle

and get stuck in! Please submit patches, or links to git branches, as
bugs on <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bustle>.

In new code, try to follow
<https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide/blob/master/haskell-style.md>.
Certain authors did not follow it in the past but it seems like a good kind of
thing to aim for.
