Bustle 0.3.1 (2012-01-09)
-------------------------

The “How do I dress up as shared global mutable state?” release.

This release finally allows you to record complete D-Bus sessions,
including message bodies, and browse them in the user interface!

As a result, there is a new logger, `bustle-pcap`, which logs D-Bus
traffic to Pcap files; and Bustle itself now depends on the [pcap][] and
[dbus-core][] packages. Your old logs should still be loaded just fine,
but since they don't contain message body data, you won't be able to see
it in the UI.

Also, as of this release binary tarballs will be provided for those not
interested in compiling Bustle themselves.

Bustle 0.2.5 (2011-06-25)
-------------------------

The “Why go all the way to Glastonbury to not watch U2 when you can just
not turn on the BBC at any point this weekend to not watch them?”
release.

This adds a sidebar with statistics about the log: namely, method call
and signal emission frequency, and total/mean times spent in method
calls. This code has mostly been sitting around unreleased since
November. Sorry, dear users!


Bustle 0.2.4 (2011-06-06)
-------------------------

The “I think I'm a panda” release. There's just a few bits and pieces of
clean-up along with a couple of bug fixes in this release. Hopefully
there will be more interesting stuff in the next release.

While we're here, Bustle's git repository has moved to freedesktop.org,
and it now has a bug tracker there too. Browse the source at
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/bustle/>; see open bugs at
<http://wjt.me.uk/bustle/bugs>; file new ones at
<http://wjt.me.uk/bustle/new-bug>. Astonishing!

Fixes:

* The viewer is now much more tolerant of inconsistencies in log files.
  (fd.o#35297; thanks to Marco Barisione for the report)

* The linking order for bustle-dbus-monitor is fixed. (Sergei
  Trofimovich)


Bustle 0.2.3 (2010-10-29)
-------------------------

The “Will it be a scone? Or will it be a lecture in category theory?”
release.

Enhancements:

*  You can now display two logs (for the session bus and the system bus)
   side by side. This is handy if you want to match up timestamps
   between the two logs.


Bustle 0.2.2 (2010-06-29)
-------------------------

The “Shepherded” release.

Fixes:

*  Suppress messages sent to the bus by bus name, rather than object
   path. This prevents Bustle blowing up when (buggy) clients call
   methods on / rather than on /org/freedesktop/DBus. (Thanks to
   Guillaume Desmottes for reporting the issue.)

*  Build against the re-namespaced Pango in Gtk2HS 0.11, and clean up a
   tonne of warnings. I think I've kept backwards compatibility with old
   enough Gtk2HSes and GHCs for this to work with the versions in Ubuntu
   10.04 and other recent-but-not-futuristic distros, but haven't
   actually tried it. Drop me a mail in the event of landing on water.
   (Thanks to Chris Lamb for upstreaming this from Debian bug #587132.)


Bustle 0.2.1 (2009-12-02)
-------------------------

The “Going down where the Firefly goes” release.

Enhancements:

*  The handling of services with multiple well-known names has improved.
   Whereas previously one name was (essentially) randomly-chosen, now
   all names owned by a service are shown in the diagram.

*  When a service falls off the bus, its column goes away to indicate
   that.

*  Strings are now ellipsized if necessary.

*  Method returns now include the object path and method name so you
   don't have to look it up yourself.

*  The UI is less spartan: you can open files, and launch it without
   passing at least one filename as a command-line argument.

Fixes:

*  The UI handles parse errors gracefully rather than, uhm, throwing an
   exception and dying.

*  bustle-dbus-monitor now has rudimentary cross-compilation support, by
   respecting $CC and friends. (Marc Kleine-Budde)

*  You can now kill the monitor immediately with ^C, rather than waiting
   for another message to arrive. (Lennart Poettering, from a patch for
   dbus-monitor)

Notes:

*  While your old logs should continue to work with the new viewer, the
   reverse is not true: the changes to name handling required modifying
   the log format.


Bustle 0.2.0 (2009-04-03)
-------------------------

The "new monkey makes me sad :-(" release.

Enhancements:

*  Add a menu item to save a PDF of the diagram.

*  Show the elapsed time between a method call and its return.

*  Add new tools to count method calls and signals, sum the total time
   spent per method call, and generate .dot graphs (Dafydd Harries).

Fixes:

*  Don't crash on empty logs, or logs containing calls on interface
   "<none>".

*  Compile with new Gtk2HS and GHC 6.10 (Chris Lamb).
