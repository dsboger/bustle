		<_p>Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity.</_p>
		<_p>It shows signal emissions, method calls and their
		    corresponding returns, with time stamps for each individual
		    event and the duration of each method call. This can help
		    you check for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your
		    D-Bus-based application isn't performing as well as you
		    like. It also provides statistics like signal frequencies
		    and average method call times.</_p>
