Bustle 0.2.1 (2009-12-02)
=========================

The “Going down where the Firefly goes” release.

Enhancements:

 • The handling of services with multiple well-known names has improved.
   Whereas previously one name was (essentially) randomly-chosen, now
   all names owned by a service are shown in the diagram.

 • When a service falls off the bus, its column goes away to indicate
   that.

 • Strings are now ellipsized if necessary.

 • Method returns now include the object path and method name so you
   don't have to look it up yourself.

 • The UI is less spartan: you can open files, and launch it without
   passing at least one filename as a command-line argument.

Fixes:

 • The UI handles parse errors gracefully rather than, uhm, throwing an
   exception and dying.

 • bustle-dbus-monitor now has rudimentary cross-compilation support, by
   respecting $CC and friends. (Marc Kleine-Budde)

 • You can now kill the monitor immediately with ^C, rather than waiting
   for another message to arrive. (Lennart Poettering, from a patch for
   dbus-monitor)

Notes:

 • While your old logs should continue to work with the new viewer, the
   reverse is not true: the changes to name handling required modifying
   the log format.

Bustle 0.2.0 (2009-04-03)
=========================

The "new monkey makes me sad :-(" release.

Enhancements:

 * Add a menu item to save a PDF of the diagram.

 * Show the elapsed time between a method call and its return.

 * Add new tools to count method calls and signals, sum the total time
   spent per method call, and generate .dot graphs (Dafydd Harries).

Fixes:

 * Don't crash on empty logs, or logs containing calls on interface
   "<none>".

 * Compile with new Gtk2HS and GHC 6.10 (Chris Lamb).
